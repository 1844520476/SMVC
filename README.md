### I have attempted to build a training framework for multi-view learning (the clustering part has already been completed). It includes functionalities such as reading datasets(.mat), data processing (with noise, missing data, and misalignment), replaceable network construction modules, loss functions, training data saving, visualization, and various other analytical utilities. You are welcome to reference it.(｡･∀･)ﾉﾞ
