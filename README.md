# SMVC
# I have built a training framework for multi-view learning (the clustering part has been completed), which includes functionalities such as reading .mat datasets, data processing (with noise, missing data, and misalignment), replaceable network construction modules, loss functions, training data saving, visualization, and various other analytical utilities. Everyone is welcome to reference and use it.
